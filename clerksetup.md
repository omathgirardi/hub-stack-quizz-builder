# Build your own sign-in-or-up page for your React app with Clerk

> There are many routing libraries available for React, but Clerk Docs uses React Router as it's the most popular and well-supported routing library for React. If you're using a different routing library, use these guides as a starting point.

This guide shows you how to use the [`<SignIn />`](https://clerk.com/docs/react/reference/components/authentication/sign-in.md) component to build a custom page **that allows users to sign in or sign up within a single flow**.

To set up separate sign-in and sign-up pages, follow this guide, and then follow the [`custom sign-up page guide`](https://clerk.com/docs/react/guides/development/custom-sign-up-page.md).

> If prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API. For more information, see the [custom flow guides](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/overview.md).

1. ## Build a sign-in-or-up page

   The following example demonstrates how to render the [`<SignIn />`](https://clerk.com/docs/react/reference/components/authentication/sign-in.md) component on a dedicated page.

   **React Router**

   > This example assumes you've added React Router to your application. If you haven't, see the [`dedicated tutorial`](https://clerk.com/docs/react/guides/development/declarative-mode.md).

   Create a `src/sign-in.tsx` file and add the following code:

   ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/sign-in.tsx' }}
   import { SignIn } from '@clerk/react'

   export default function SignInPage() {
     return <SignIn />
   }
   ```

   **No router**

   > Since this approach uses `window.location.pathname` instead of a routing library, the app will flicker on navigation between pages and steps. For production apps, consider using a routing library like [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/).

   Update your `src/App.tsx` file to add the `SignInPage()` component and handle the `/sign-in` route.

   ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/App.tsx', mark: [1, [3, 5], [8, 16]] }}
   import { Show, SignInButton, SignUpButton, UserButton, SignIn } from '@clerk/react'

   function SignInPage() {
     return <SignIn path="/sign-in" />
   }

   export default function App() {
     const path = window.location.pathname

     if (path === '/sign-in' || path.startsWith('/sign-in/')) {
       return (
         <div>
           <SignInPage />
         </div>
       )
     }

     return (
       <header>
         <Show when="signed-out">
           <SignInButton />
           <SignUpButton />
         </Show>
         <Show when="signed-in">
           <UserButton />
         </Show>
       </header>
     )
   }
   ```
2. ## Configure your sign-in-or-up page

   **React Router**

   Update your `src/main.tsx` to import the sign-in page, add a route for it, and configure `<ClerkProvider>` with the following props:

   - Set `signInUrl` to tell Clerk where the `<SignIn />` component is being hosted.
   - Set `signInFallbackRedirectUrl` as a fallback URL in case users visit the `/sign-in` route directly.
   - Set `signUpFallbackRedirectUrl` as a fallback URL in case users select the 'Don't have an account? Sign up' link at the bottom of the component.

   Learn more about these props and how to customize Clerk's redirect behavior in the [dedicated guide](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/customize-redirect-urls.md).

   ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/main.tsx', mark: [6, [16, 18], 22] }}
   import { StrictMode } from 'react'
   import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
   import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, useNavigate } from 'react-router'
   import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/react'
   import './index.css'
   import SignInPage from './sign-in.tsx'
   import App from './App.tsx'

   function RootLayout() {
     const navigate = useNavigate()

     return (
       <ClerkProvider
         routerPush={(to) => navigate(to)}
         routerReplace={(to) => navigate(to, { replace: true })}
         signInUrl="/sign-in"
         signInFallbackRedirectUrl="/"
         signUpFallbackRedirectUrl="/"
       >
         <Routes>
           <Route path="/" element={<App />} />
           {/* Must be a splat route (catch-all) route to handle nested paths */}
           <Route path="/sign-in/*" element={<SignInPage />} />
         </Routes>
       </ClerkProvider>
     )
   }

   createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
     <StrictMode>
       <BrowserRouter>
         <RootLayout />
       </BrowserRouter>
     </StrictMode>,
   )
   ```

   **No router**

   Update your `<ClerkProvider>` to add the `signInUrl`, `signInFallbackRedirectUrl`, and `signUpFallbackRedirectUrl` props.

   - Set `signInUrl` to tell Clerk where the `<SignIn />` component is being hosted.
   - Set `signInFallbackRedirectUrl` as a fallback URL in case users visit the `/sign-in` route directly.
   - Set `signUpFallbackRedirectUrl` as a fallback URL in case users select the 'Don't have an account? Sign up' link at the bottom of the component.

   Learn more about these props and how to customize Clerk's redirect behavior in the [dedicated guide](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/customize-redirect-urls.md).

   ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/main.tsx', mark: [[16, 18]] }}
   import React from 'react'
   import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
   import App from './App.tsx'
   import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/react'

   const PUBLISHABLE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

   if (!PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {
     throw new Error('Add your Clerk Publishable Key to the .env file')
   }

   ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
     <React.StrictMode>
       <ClerkProvider
         publishableKey={PUBLISHABLE_KEY}
         signInUrl="/sign-in"
         signInFallbackRedirectUrl="/"
         signUpFallbackRedirectUrl="/"
       >
         <App />
       </ClerkProvider>
     </React.StrictMode>,
   )
   ```
3. ## Visit your new page

   Run your project with the following command:

   ```npm
   npm run dev
   ```

   Visit your new custom page locally at [localhost:5173/sign-in](http://localhost:5173/sign-in).
